# Alexa-Final-Project-Design

This alexa skill is defined to play a word scramble game with the user! 

    This Alexa skill is open when prompted to buy the user and then sets all global variables to zero just incase they were not already. 
Once this is done it explains to the user how to play and asks if they are ready. When the user says "yes" it brings them to the
wordOne intent which picks a random spot in an array full of possible words to be scrambled and puts the word into an array for holding 
so it can be comparerd to later on. After this it gets sent into a method which splits up the string into an array of letters. Then that 
array gets sent into another method which randomizes where the letters are in the string and returns it into the wordOne intent function.
Then this intent tells the user what there scramble letters are and awaits the answer. This answer gets assigned to the slot value and 
calls the next intent wordOneAnswer. This intent sends the users answer into a method which compares the users answer to the answer held 
at the particular index in the wordDone array and adds to the score accordingly. Next the wordOneAnswer intent runs a method which checks
if the game is over and who one. Then it builds the alexa response accordingly and emits it to the user. If the user decidews to play again
they will prompt the first 'play' intent to fire. 

    In the Alexa developer side of things there are seven intents, four of which are built in handelers. The first play intent fires with 
the user saying lets play and leads into the next intent called wordOne. wordOne gets called anytime the user answers "yes", which happens 
the very begining and after each word.once the user actually answers the word his answer is saved into the wordOneAnswerSlot value which
helps find this value later and this is what is used to call on the next wordOneAnswer intent. Additionally Alexa required a custom slot 
type to be made which is just filled with all the words placed into the array in which the words to scramble are choosen from.
