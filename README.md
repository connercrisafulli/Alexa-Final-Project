# Alexa-Final-Project-README

This alexa skill is defined to play a word scramble game with the user! 

    The skill starts by randomly selecting a single word from a large selection of words to scramble. Then Alexa will read the user there 
word and they will try to unscramble it. If the user succedes in unscrambling the word they get a poin; however, if they get it wrong 
Alexa will recieve the point and the program will tell you what the word was. The game continues until one party, the user or Alexa, 
obtains a score of three points. At this point you will be given the option to play again. 

    In order to invoke the word scramble the user will have to prompt Alexa with "open word scramble and lets play". Once this is started
the only other user input needed is the user's answer to unscramble the word and answers of yes when Alexa asks do you want to move on.
At the end Alexa will tell the user how to play again, say "lets play again", and if the user so chooses this will also be required of
the user to say in order to keep the skill going. If at any point the user wishes to stop that is all they have to say, "stop", and 
Alexa will proceed to say goodbye and and close the program.
